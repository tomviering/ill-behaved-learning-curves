# Installation
1. Clone repository to your local PC: 
```
git clone https://github.com/tomviering/ill-behaved-learning-curves.git
```
2. **Optional:** navigate to the root directory of the project and execute 
```
download_dependencies('all')
``` 
to download all additional dependencies for all experiments and the author provided results. 

3. **Optional:** download and extract [export_fig](https://nl.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-export_fig) in the directory 'export_fig' (only required for exporting figures).

4. **Optional:** download and extract [panel-2.14](https://nl.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/20003-panel) in the directory 'panel-2.14' (for pretty version of Fig 3). 

# Running the experiments

The experiments that produce the learning curves for the figures of the paper 
are sometimes time consuming because many repitions are required to obtain smooth learning curves. 
Therefore, we have prepared two versions of all the experiments:

1. run_experiments_fast.m - total running time about 10 minutes. all the results are saved to the folder 'results_fast'.
2. run_experiments_long.m - total running time about **6 hours**. all the results are saved to the folder 'results_long'.

These scripts also generate the (bare bones) learning curve figures.
We have also performed these computations for you and we provide them with this repository. To download the results, execute 
```
download_dependencies('author_results')
```
They are automatically placed in the folders 'results_fast' and 'results_long'. 

# The plots

## plots_learning_curves.m 

A simplified script that shows all ill-behaved learning curves (Fig 3) and the surface plot (Fig 2) with minimal styling. Requires all result files in the folders 'results_fast' or 'results_long'.

## figure1_crossing_curves.m

The crossing learning curves of Fig 1 (not based on actual data).

## figure2_surface_plot.m 

The pretty version of the surface plot of Figure 2, requires the result file `2_peaking.mat'. 

## figure3_ill_behaved_curves.m 

The pretty version of all ill-behaved learning curves of Figure 3.

## figure4_dipping_distribution 

Visualizes the distribution for the dipping learning curve.
